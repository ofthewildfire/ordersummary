## My process

Used a mobile first approach but truthfully this was so tiny, it didn't matter,
or maybe I dont know enough to know if it did. :)

### Built with

- [x] Semantic HTML5 markup
- [x] CSS custom properties
- [x] Flexbox
- [x] Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing new! Actually.

### Continued development

I must look into controlling background images. I have a poor understanding of
that.
